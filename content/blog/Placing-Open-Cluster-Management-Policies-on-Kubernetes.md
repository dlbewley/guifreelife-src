[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management][4] (RHACM) enables Open Cluster Management policy driven governance of an entire fleet of Kubernetes clusters. Associating policies with the appropriate clusters is a very flexible operation and requires understanding resources like Placements and ManagedClusterSetBindings. So let's get familiar!

# Open Cluster Management

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes implements the [Open Cluster Management][6] APIs for the deployment (placement) of governance policies.

## Policies

`Policy` resources are used to enact policies on a managed cluster. There is a large [collection of policies][5] that you can draw upon and customize for your particular use cases. This post focused only on the process of associating a policy with a cluster rather than what is in a given policy or how it is enacted.

Policies are scoped to a namespace as you can see in the API resources table above. Policies can be associated to specific clusters in a fleet through a `Placement` or a `PlacementRule` resource.

# Placement Rules

In the recent past resources called `PlacementRule` and `PlacementBindings` were used to associate a policy with a cluster. Those resources still exist but are `PlacementRule` is now deprecated in favor of the `Placement` resource. This change enables greater control, and brings with it some other resources to facilitate the grouping of clusters together into sets. These cluster sets enable more configurable RBAC.

# Managed Clusters and Managed Cluster Sets

RHACM can manage OpenShift and other Kubernetes clusters. See my previous [posts on RHACM]({{< ref "/tags/RHACM" >}}) for more background and recorded demonstrations.

Each  Kubernetes cluster managed by RHACM is represented by a `ManagedCluster` resource. This resource is cluster scoped. You can see this in the table below.

Multiple managed clusters may be grouped together into `ManagedClusterSets` for administrative and RBAC purposes. RHACM has two pre-defined cluster sets named _Global_ and _Default_. All clusters will be in the Global set, and they can be added to at most only one other set. You might create a cluster set for lifecycle like _Dev_ or cloud like _AWS_ for example.

## Managed Cluster Set Bindings

A `ManagedClusterSetBinding` is a namespaced resource designed to create a relationship between a namespace and a `ManagedClusterSet`. This resource is prerequisite to a `Placement`. Without this, a placement has no clusters visible to match against.

The Global managed cluserset set is already bound to the `open-cluster-management-global-set` by default. You can see this in the console when listing the cluster sets.

 <!-- if you want "Placement" to act the same way as "PlacementRule", you can create the policy, placement, and placement binding in the "open-cluster-management-global-set" since all clusters are bound to that namespace. -->

# Placement

A `Placement` exists to make a scheduling decision with regard to `Policies` and a selection of `ManagedClusters`. The result of a placement decision is a list of `ManagedClusters`. 

The placement decision begins with a list of managed clusters visibile through the lense of a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` in the same namespace.  Once the placement has this list it may optionally further winnow down that list through predicates like label selectors.

> :notebook: **Important**
> * `Placement` label selectors only match clusters that are visible via a `ManagedClusterSetBinding`
> * No clusters will be selected if no cluster set is bound to the namespace holding the placement resource

> ‚≠ê **Pro Tip** Use `oc explain placement` to find the information I reformatted below.

**Here is how the placement policy combines with other selection methods to determine a matching list of ManagedClusters:**

1. Kubernetes clusters are registered with hub as cluster-scoped `ManagedClusters`
2. `ManagedClusters` are organized into cluster-scoped `ManagedClusterSets`
3. `ManagedClusterSets` are bound to workload namespaces using `ManagedClusterSetBindings`
4. Namespace-scoped `Placements` specify a _slice_ of `ManagedClusterSets` which select a working set of _potential_ `ManagedClusters`
5. Then `Placements` _subselect_ from that working set using label/claim selection.

## Subselecting from Cluster Sets with Predicates

A placement can explicitly list the ClusterSets of interest or it can simply list the cluster label selectors. BUT the universe of possible clusters is constrained to those bound to the namespace via the [managed cluster set bindings]({{< ref "#managedclustersetbindings" >}}).

Here are examples of both use cases. Of course they may also be combined into one.

> :one: If a `Placement` specifies `spec.clusterSets[]` then it may specify a `spec.predicates.requiredClusterSelector{}` to filter the set of managed clusters.

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement-1
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  clusterSets:
    - clusterset1
    - clusterset2
```

> :two: If a `Placement` does not specify any `spec.clusterSets[]` it may still specify a `spec.predicates.requiredClusterSelector{}` which will only match against clusters found in sets bound to the current namespace (by a `ManagedClusterSetBinding`.)

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: placement-2
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  predicates:
  - requiredClusterSelector:
      labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
          - {key: environment, operator: In, values: ["dev"]}
```

When more than one predicate is defined, they are OR'ed.  Refer to the [documentation][3] for more detail.

# Placement Binding

Once a placement produces a list of managed clusters the policy resource must be associated with and ultimately propagated to the clusters. This is the job of the `PlacementBinding`.

> :notebook:  A `PlacementBinding` binds a `Placement` to subjects (eg. `Policies`, `PolicySets`)

This example is pulled from a [documentation sample][1].

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:
  name: binding-policy-role
placementRef:
  name: placement-policy-role
  kind: Placement
  apiGroup: cluster.open-cluster-management.io
subjects:
- name: policy-role
  kind: Policy
  apiGroup: policy.open-cluster-management.io
```

# Fitting it all together

In this visual representation there are 3 corporate standard policies which we expect to apply to all 4 of our clusters, and there is 1 additional policy which we expect to apply to the production clusters.

This is accomplished by creating a standard ("STD") Placement that targets all clusters and a PROD Placement that matches only the production cluster. This targetting is permitted by the existance of the ManagedClusterSetBinding in this same namespace.

# Summary

`ManagedClusterSetBindings` provide a controlled lense through which ManagedClusterSets may be managed. By controlling the creation of ManagedClusterSetBindings, the Policy management task may be delegated to a namespace administrator while retaining the control over which clusters may be impacted by that namespace administrator.
